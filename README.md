# Genetic-Algorithm-and-VGG
This project aims to improve the structure of VGG using genetic algorithm. We use a genotype to present a kind of structure of the neural network.
At every iteration, we need to let genotypes to evolve and then transfer these genotype to neural network to evaluate it.
here, main.py is the main file, and the whole process of genetic algorithm is in the Genetic_algo.py.
